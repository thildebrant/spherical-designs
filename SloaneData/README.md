the des3-*.txt files were downloaded from Neil Slone's website https://neilsloane.com/sphdesigns/dim3/
the file format is des3-N-t.txt where des3 corresponds to R^3, so on S^2; N is the number of points, and t is the strength of the design. 
"A set of N points is called a spherical t-design if the integral of any polynomial of degree at most t over the sphere is equal to the average value of the polynomial over the set of N points.
Given a value of N, one wishes to choose the N points so as to maximize t."

the *.json files were processed using processDesigns.m and then the results were verified using process_designs.py
